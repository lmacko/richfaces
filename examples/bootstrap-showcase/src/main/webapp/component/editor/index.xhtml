		<h1>
			<code>r:editor</code>
		</h1>
		<p>
			The <b>r:editor</b> is input component acting as WYSIWYG editor.
		</p>

		<p>
			Using <b>attribute value</b>, you can point editor's value into your
			model. For output of editor's value (HTML), you can use un-escaped
			output with &lt;h:outputText escape="false" value="..." /&gt; as in
			sample bellow.
		</p>

		<p>
			Editor also throws semantical <b>DOM events</b>, similarly to
			standard input: change, init, focus, blur, dirty. You can react on
			these events both, with client-side behaviors or by programmatically
			with event handler attributes (oninit, etc.).
		</p>

		<p>You can combine Editor's features to achieve more complex
			scenarios, in powerful declarative manner.</p>

		<p>
			For example, you can simply achieve <b>auto-saving</b> feature with
			dirty DOM event and request delay configured using r:attachQueue
			behavior, . Check out the sample bellow: you can change the value and
			either leave the editor (blur) or wait 1000 ms to trigger ajax update
			of output panel bellow.
		</p>

		<h2>Custom layouts</h2>
		<p>
			<b>r:autocomplete</b> component could be used to show complex popups
			with suggestions. You need to remember next points to use it in that
			way:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Passing custom objects instead of just String's to list
				requires you to define <b>var</b> attribute (similar as using table
				components). That variable will be used while iterating the
				suggestions and encoding the popup using your custom layout.
			</li>
			<li>As it was just mentioned you're responsible for popup markup
				definition in that case and should use nested components for that.</li>
			<li>Type of the layout encoded using nested components should be
				defined using <b>layout</b> attribute. Possible values are <i>'list'</i>
				(suggestions wrapped to HTML unordered list), <i>'div'</i> (default
				one, suggestions wrapped with just div element) and <i>'table'</i>
				(suggestions are encoded as table rows, columns definition required
				in that case).
			</li>
			<li>Using <b>fetchValue</b> attribute you should define the
				String which should be inserted to input after some row get
				selected. If not defined just your object <b>toString()</b> method
				used.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<ui:include src="/resources/sample.xhtml">
			<ui:param name="tag" value="autocomplete" />
			<ui:param name="sample" value="custom-layouts" />
		</ui:include>


		<h2>Client filter</h2>
		<p>
			When a suggestion request is sent to the server via an Ajax call you
			have full control over the suggestion list. Once that data is on the
			client the default filter is <i>startsWith</i>. This can be changed
			to any custom JavaScript filter you wish. This example shows you how
			to define and call a custom filter for <i>contains</i> instead of <i>startsWith</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <b>clientFilterFunction</b> attribute accepts a custom JavaScript
			function name. This function should have two parameters; <b>subString</b>(current
			input value considering tokens) and <b>value</b> (currently iterated
			item value) and return boolean flag which means if the value
			satisfies the substring passed. The function will be called for every
			available suggestion in order to construct a new list of suggestions.
